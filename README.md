# VSI-HTML-Project
HTML page about the show She-Ra
This project was created in the summer of 2020 for the Viterbi Summer Institute Program, a program intended to help students from historically underprivileged communities adapt to college through rigorous courses and research. For this particular assignment, students were tasked to create a webpage about their favorite show using HTML and CSS.
